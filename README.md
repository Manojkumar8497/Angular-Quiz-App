## Technologies Used

I've used Angular, Angular Material, and Firebase for this project. The Angular Material plays the main role for the UI side and I used the firebase as a server-side. 

I've taken the Quiz data from the cloud firestore database. Before starting the project, Create one cloud firestore database in firebase. After that, you're able to see this screen.

<b>Note:</b> You need to add this firebase credentials into environment.ts file.
